k6 v0.26.0 is here! :tada:

This release contains mostly bug fixes, though it also has a few new features, enhancements. This includes brand new compatibility mode, json report, speedups to InfluxDB and JSON outputs, a brand new CSV output, multiple layered response body decompression, being able to use `console` in the initcontext, new optional column in the summary and docker improvements.


Thanks to  @Sirozha1337, @openmohan, @MMartyn, @KajdeMunter, @dmitrytokarev and @dimatock for contributing to this release!

## New Features!

### Add JS compatibility mode option (#1206)

This adds a way to currently disable the included core.js (v2) and babel (v6.4.2) transformation and instead only rely on the GOJA VM and what is build into k6.
This can be configured through teh new CLI run `--compatibility-mode` flag and `K6_COMPATIBILITY_MODE` environmental variable with possible values:

    "extended": this is the default and current compatibility mode, which uses Babel and core.js to achieve ES6+ compatibility.
    "base": an optional mode that disables loading of Babel and core.js, running scripts with only Goja's native ES5.1+ compatibility. If the test scripts don't require ES6 compatibility (e.g. they were previously transformed by Babel), this option can be used to reduce RAM usage during test runs.

More info what this means can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.k6.io/docs/javascript-compatibility-mode).

Our benchmarks show considerable drop in memory usage of around 80% for simple scripts but still quite considerable (50% in the case of 2mb script with a lot of data in it). The CPU usage is mostly unchanged except that k6 does initialize a lot faster. All of those benifits will be most noticable if k6 is used with big number of VUs (1k+). More performance comparison can be found in #1167.

### JSON report (#1168)

This returns (from the very early days of k6) the ability to output the data from the end of test summary in machine readable JSON file.
This can be done with the `--summary-export` file and will include data for all metrics, checks and thresholds.

### CSV output was added (#1067)

There is an entirely new output `csv` that can be enabled by using `--out csv`. There are two things that can be configured: the output file with `K6_CSV_FILENAME` by default it's `file.csv` and the interval of pushing metrics to disk which is configured with `K6_CSV_SAVE_INTERVAL` and is 1 second by default. Both of those can be configured by the cli as well. `--out csv=somefile.csv` will output to `somefile.csv` and `--out file_name=somefile.csv,save_interval=2s` will output again to `somefile.csv` but every 2 seconds instead of every second.

The first line of the output is the names of columns and looks like:
```
metric_name,timestamp,metric_value,check,error,error_code,group,method,name,proto,status,subproto,tls_version,url,extra_tags
http_reqs,1573131887,1.000000,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
http_req_duration,1573131887,116.774321,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
http_req_blocked,1573131887,148.691247,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
http_req_connecting,1573131887,112.593448,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
```

All thanks to @Sirozha1337!


### JSON output optimizations (#1114)

The JSON output no longer blocks the goroutine sending samples to all outputs but instead (like all other outputs) buffers the samples and writes them on regular intervals (100ms and is currently not configurable). It also uses slightly faster way of doing it that would decrease the memory usage by a small amount.

Another improvement is the ability to compress the generated JSON file by simply adding `.gz` to the end of the file name. Compressed files are typically 30x smaller.

### InfluxDB refactoring (#1113)

The InfluxDB output has been updated to use less memory and try to send smaller and consistent chunks of data to InfluxDB in order to not drop packages and use less memory. This is primarily done by sending data in parallel as this seems to be better from a performance perspective and more importantly queuing data in separate packages so we don't send the data for a very long period all at once. Also, the library used was updated which also decreased the memory usage.

Two new options were added:
K6_INFLUXDB_PUSH_INTERVAL - configures at what interval the collected data is queued to be sent to InfluxDB. By default this is "1s".
K6_INFLUXDB_CONCURRENT_WRITES - configures the number of concurrent write calls to InfluxDB. If this limit is reached the next writes will be queued and made when a slot is freed. By default this is 10.

### `console` is now available in the init context (#982):

For a long time, this wasn't supported which made debugging things outside of VU code much harder, but now it's here.

There is currently known bug is that calls to console in the init context will always write to the stdout regardless of using `--console-output`.

### HTTP: request body decompression with multiple layered algorithms (#1125)

In v0.25.0 compressing bodies was added and it had support for multiple layered algorithms. Now this is also true for decompressing bodies when k6 gets them as responses.


### Summary: add an optional count column (#1143)

The `--summary-trend-stats` now also recognizes `count` as a valid column and will output the count of samples in all Trend metrics.

### Docker compose refactor (#1183)

The example docker-compose that enabled easy running of InfluxDB+Grafana+k6 was refactored and all the images were updated to use the latest stable versions.

Thanks, @KajdeMunter!

Also the k6 Dockerfile alpine version was bumped to 3.10. Thanks @dmitrytokarev!

## Bugs fixed!
* Cloud: Stop sending metrics to the cloud output when the cloud returns that you have reached the limit (#1130)
* JS: Fail a `check` if an uncaught error is thrown inside of it (#1137)
* HTTP: Replace user credentials with `*` when emitting http metrics (#1132)
* WS: Many fixes:
  - return error instead of panicking if error happens during the making of the websocket connection (#1127)
  - calling the `error` handler on an error when closing the websocket, instead of calling with a null (#1118)
  - correctly handle server initiated close (#1186)
* JSON: Better error messages when parsing JSON fails. Now telling you at which line and row the
  error is instead of just the offset. Thanks, @openmohan (#905)
* HTTP: Use Request's `GetBody` in order to be able to get the body multiple times for a single
  request as needed in 308 redirects of posts and if the server sends GOAWAY with no error (#1093)
* JS: Don't export internal go struct fields of script options (#1151)
* JS: Ignore `minIterationDuration` for `setup` and `teardown` (#1175)
* UX: Better timeout messages for `setup` and `teardown` timeouts including a hint on how to fix it (#1173)
* HTTP: Return error on any request that returns 101 status code as k6 currently doesn't support any protocol upgrade behaviour (#1172)
* HTTP: Correctly capture TCP reset by peer and broken pipe errors and give them the appropriate error_code (#1164)
* UX: Don't interpret not `K6_` prefixed env variables as k6 configuration, most notable `DURATION` and `ITERATIONS` (#1215)
* JS/html: When using `Selection.map` was not wrapping the nodes it was outputting which lead to wrongly using the internal `Goquery.Selection` instead of k6's `Selection`. Thanks to @MMartyn for reporting this! (#1198)
* HTTP: Correctly set the cookie for the current URL not the one the current request is redirecting to. Thanks @dimatock! (#1201)
* Cloud: Add token to make calls to the cloud API idempotent (#1208)
* Cloud: Improve aggregation of http metrics for different URLs but having the same `name` tag (#1220)
* Cloud: Fix a bug where you weren't able to run a script, outputting to cloud, if it was using the shortcut urls for github/cdnjs (#1237)
* UX: Include the path to the directory when a directory is used with `open()` (#1238)


## Internals

* CI: Stop using external service for testing websockets (#1138) and remove the last use of the external `httpbin.org`(#1213)
* CI: Move to go 1.13 and back and to 1.13 again after a bug was fixed in the stdlib (#1145, #1157, #1177)
* CI: Fix a test on MacOS (#1142)
* CI: Fixing flaky tests (#1149, #1223)
* Drop an external dependency for getting user's `configdir` (#1162)
* Use bitmask for checking whether system tags are enabled, adding some small speedup where this is required (#1148)
* Update `envconfig` as it was very old and the newer versions had fixes and features we want (#1214)
* Metrics: Emit iterations as part of `netext.NetTrail`, instead of as a standalone one. Also cutting down on amount of bytes we sent to the cloud output (#1203)
* UX: K6 Version will now include the git commit it was build from (in most cases ...) (#1235)

## Breaking changes

* Not really a breaking change, but `k6 convert` is getting deprecated in favor of [har-to-k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/har-to-k6). As such not new enchantment or bug fixes are expected for the internal converter. (#1228)
