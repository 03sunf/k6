k6 v0.26.0 is here! :tada:

This release contains mostly bug fixes, though it also has a few new features, enhancements. This include speedups to influxdb and json output, a brand new csv output, multiple layered response body decompression, being able to use `console` in the initcontext, new optional column in the summary and docker improvements.


Thanks to  @Sirozha1337, @openmohan, @MMartyn, @KajdeMunter, @dmitrytokarev and @dimatock for contributing to this release!

## New Features!

### CSV output was added (#1067)

There is entirely new output `csv` that can be enabled by using `--out csv`. There are two things that can be configured: the output file with `K6_CSV_FILENAME` by default it's `file.csv` and the interval of pushing metrics to disk which is configured with `K6_CSV_SAVE_INTERVAL` and is 1 second by default. Both of those can be configured by the cli as well. `--out csv=somefile.csv` will output to `somefile.csv` and `--out file_name=somefile.csv,save_interval=2s` will output again to `somefile.csv` but every 2 seconds instead of every second.

The first line of the output is the names of columns and looks like:
```
metric_name,timestamp,metric_value,check,error,error_code,group,method,name,proto,status,subproto,tls_version,url,extra_tags
http_reqs,1573131887,1.000000,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
http_req_duration,1573131887,116.774321,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
http_req_blocked,1573131887,148.691247,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
http_req_connecting,1573131887,112.593448,,,,,GET,http://httpbin.org/,HTTP/1.1,200,,,http://httpbin.org/,
```

All thanks to @Sirozha1337!


### JSON output optimizations (#1114)

The json output no longer blocks the goroutine sending samples to all outputs but instead (like all other outputs) buffers the samples and writes them on regular intervals (100ms and is currently not configurable). It also uses slightly faster way of doing it that would decrease the memory usage by a small amount. 

Another, bigger, improvement is that if now the output file ends in `.gz` the output will be gzipped which decreased the size of the output file by up to 30x when tested.

### Influxdb refactoring (#1113)

the InfluxDB output has been updated to use less memory and try to send smaller and consistent chunks of data to InfluxDB in order to not drop packages and use less memory. This is primarily done by sending data in parallel as this seems to be better from performance perspective and more importantly queuing data in separate packages so we don't send the data for a very long period all at once. Also the library used was updated which also decreased the memory usage.

Two new options were added:
K6_INFLUXDB_PUSH_INTERVAL - configures at what interval the collected data is queued to be send to InfluxDB. By default this is "1s".
K6_INFLUXDB_CONCURRENT_WRITES - configures the amount of concurrent write calls to InfluxDB. If this limit is reached the next writes will be queued and made when a slot is freed. By default this is 10.

### `console` is now available in the init context (#982):

For a long time this wasn't supported which made debugging things outside of VU code much harder, but now it's here. 

There is currently known bug is that calls to console in the init context will always write to the stout regardless of using `--console-output`.

### HTTP: request body decompression with multiple layered algorithms (#1125)

In v0.25.0 compressing bodies was added and it had support for multiple layered algorithms. Now this is also true for decompressing bodies when k6 gets them as responses.


### Summary: add an optional count column (#1143)

The `--summary-trend-stats` now also recognises `count` as a valid column and will output the count of samples in all Trend metrics. 

### Docker compose refactor (#1183)

The example docker-compose that enabled easy running of influxdb+grafana+k6 was refactored and all the images were updated to use the latest stable versions. 

Thanks, @KajdeMunter!

Also the k6 Dockerfile alpine version was bumped to 3.10. Thanks @dmitrytokarev!

## Bugs fixed!
* Cloud: Stop sending metrics to the cloud output when the cloud returns that you have reached the limit (#1130)
* JS: Fail a `check` if an uncaught error is thrown inside of it (#1137)
* HTTP: Replace user credentials with `*` when emitting http metrics (#1132)
* WS: Many fixes: 
  - return error instead of panicing if error happens during the making of the websocket connection (#1127)
  - calling the `error` handler on an error when closing the websocket, instead of calling with a null (#1118)
  - correctly handle server initiated close (#1186)
* JSON: Better error messages when parsing JSON fails. Now telling you at which line and row the
  error is instead of just the offset. Thanks, @openmohan (#905) 
* HTTP: Use Request's GetBody in order to be able to get the body multiple times for a single
  request as needed in 308 redirects of posts and if the server sends GOAWAY with no error (#1093)
* JS: Don't export internal go struct fields of script options (#1151)
* JS: Ignore minIterationDuration for `setup` and `teardown` (#1175)
* UX: Better timeout messages for setup and teardown timeouts including a hint on how to fix it (#1173)
* HTTP: Return error on any request that returns 101 status code as k6 currently doesn't support any protocol upgrade behaviour (#1172)
* HTTP: Correctly capture tcp reset by peer and broken pipe errors and give them the appropriate error_code (#1164)
* UX: Don't interpret not `K6_` prefixed env variables as k6 configuration, most notable `DURATION` and `ITERATIONS` (#1215)
* JS/html: When using `Selection.map` was not wrapping the nodes it was outputing which lead to wrongly using the internal `Goquery.Selection` instead of k6's `Selection`. Thanks to @MMartyn for reporting this! (#1198)
* HTTP: Correctly set the cookie for the current url not the one the current request is redirecting to. Thanks @dimatock! (#1201) 
* Cloud: Add token to make calls to the cloud API idempotent (#1208)
* Cloud: Improve aggregation of http metrics for different urls but having the same `name` tag (#1220)


## Internals

* CI: Stop using external service for testing websockets (#1138) and remove the last use of the external httpbin.org (#1213)
* CI: Move to go 1.13 and back and to 1.13 again after a bug was fixed in the stdlib (#1145, #1157, #1177)
* CI: Fix a test on MacOs (#1142)
* CI: Fixing flaky tests (#1149, #1223)
* Drop an external dependency for getting user's configdir (#1162)
* Use bitmask for checking whether system tags are enabled, adding some small speedup where this is required (#1148)
* Update envconfig as it was very old and the newer versions had fixes and features we want (#1214)
* Metrics: Emit iterations as part of netext.NetTrail, instead of as a standalone one. Also cutting down on amount of bytes we sent to the cloud output (#1203)
